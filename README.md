# general-ndvi
script for the temporal analysis of the normalized vegetable mass index of a region
Project Description
The goal of this project is to use Google Earth Engine (GEE) to visualize and analyze the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for a specific region. NDVI is an important indicator for assessing vegetation health.

#Project Steps
1 - Setting Up the Development Environment
2- Data Selection and Processing
3 - NDVI Calculation
4 - Results Visualization
5 - Temporal Analysis
6 - Documentation and Sharing

#Tools Used
1 - Google Earth Engine: Platform for geospatial data analysis.
2 - JavaScript: Programming language for development in GEE.
3 - GitHub: Source code hosting.
4 - Jupyter Notebook (optional): For documentation and presentation of results.

#Process
1. Setting Up the Development Environment
Create an account on Google Earth Engine:
Go to Google Earth Engine and request access.
Set up the development environment:
Access the Code Editor on Google Earth Engine.

2. Data Selection and Processing
   2.1 Choose the region of interest
   2.2 Select the dataset: choose according to the period of interest in: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/
3. NDVI Calculation
4. Results Visualization
5. Temporal Analysis
   5.1 Create an NDVI time series
   5.2 Add the chart to the panel
6. Documentation and Sharing
   6.1 Document the project:
   Use a README.md on GitHub to explain the project, including usage instructions and main results.
   6.2 Share the code on GitHub:
   Create a repository on GitHub and upload the code.

This project demonstrates how to use Google Earth Engine to calculate and visualize NDVI for a specific region, as well as analyze the temporal variation of the vegetation index. Proper documentation and making the code available in a GitHub repository can make this project a valuable addition to your portfolio, showcasing your skills in geospatial data analysis.
